Keep The Faith
Tiffany Cheung

The world is hopeless
It is not evident that
We live for a purpose
The truth is
We come and we go
No need to care, no need to know
They tell us
We have a heart and a soul
But that hardly changes anything, don't forget
Our lifetime is short and not within our control
The power's in believing
We should have faith in ourselves
Well, I don't think so
Most of us are meant to be ordinary
Dreams are just hopes, which never come true
It is foolish to presume that
We can all be in God's glow
The future is not in our hands
I would be lying to you if I said
We can change the world together
You need to know that
We can't make it happen
It's not wise to delude ourselves into the thought that
We are more than who we think we are.
