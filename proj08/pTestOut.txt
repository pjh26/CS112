Drawn Onward ***

The learned men of Rome
could turn a palindrome
but they were not the first.

For Adam, says the myth,
began conversing with
a sentence that reversed:
"Madam, I'm Adam" ***
seemed
a phrase to be esteemed
the moment it was popped.
But that was not to be
- his lady instantly said
"Eve" ***
which left it topped.

Eve damned Eden; mad Eve ***
bore two sons,
as goes the fable,
the first named
Cain, a maniac, ***
who slew his brother Abel.
He lived as a devil, eh? ***
Violence begat violence, until today
we panic in a pew, ***
the cycle turns anew
and descendents of Ned Ludd
-- dumb mobs -- bomb mud. ***

Asked his favorite dessert, Archimedes said,
"I prefer PI" ***

And Napoleon, post-Josephine, mused,
"Able was I, ere I saw Elba," ***
as he met his Waterloo, confused.

Anonymous, the most
prolific bard, can boast
of being host
to these:

"Was it a car or a cat I saw ?" ***

"Some men interpret nine memos." ***

"Lewd did I live, evil I did dwel." ***

"Sex at noon taxes." ***

"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" ***

"Stop, murder us not, tonsured rumpots!" ***

"Straw? No, too stupid a fad. I put soot on warts." ***

"Doc, note: I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod." ***

"Kay, a red nude, peeped under a yak." ***

and that marvel of marvels:

"Sit on a potato pan, Otis!" ***

What span, what palindromic bliss!

I've wrung the alphabet
repeatedly to get
a Janus-phrase so spry
at backwards somersaults.
But as each hope turns false,
in words, alas, drown I. ***
